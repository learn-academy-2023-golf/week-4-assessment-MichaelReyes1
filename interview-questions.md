# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: 

When you right click on a webpage and inspect the code from the webpage itself. You can look at your work and make changes without re writing your code, so you can have a visual of what your trying to build. 

Researched answer: 

its a virtual representation of the DOM and compares it to actual DOM, and will only update the parts of the DOM that has changed. it also improves performance when making applications.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:

it means you dont have to use the keyword return and it will return your last line of code 

Researched answer:

the last expression within the method is automatically returned from the method without using return which makes it much easier to read.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer:

from what we been working with so far they use different casing conventions(ruby uses snake_case and JavaScript uses camelCase), ruby file extension is .rb and JavaScript is .js, and ruby uses hashes while JavaScript uses objects.
the are alike by both sharing data types and also the same languages but cant remember the exact language names. 



Researched answer: 

they are alike by both being interpreted languages which is logic that can  be read and understood by the computer, and both are dynamically typed which allows data types to be changed while they are being used. 
JavaScript is mostly used for front-end while ruby is often used in back-end. Ruby uses 'nil' to represent the absence of a value while JavaScript uses 'undefined' and  

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: 

a tool to view and manage languages 

Researched answer: 

it controls and manages different versions of languages, frameworks or other software components, and lets developers handle multiple versions of programs or languages on a single system. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: A anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome. 

2. RSpec: a unit test framework used to describe the behavior of objects in Ruby. 

3. Test-driven development: A software development approach where developers write tests before they write the actual code. It involves a cycle of writing a test that defines a small piece of functionality, making the test fail, writing the code to pass that test, and then refactoring the code while ensuring the tests continue to pass.
